- **Guests**: Search, book, and review properties
- **Hosts**: List and manage rental properties
- **Admins**: Oversee platform operations and moderation

## Key Features

- User management with role-based access (Guest/Host/Admin)
- Property listing management with search and filtering
- Booking system with payment integration
- Review and rating system
- Admin dashboard for platform oversight
- Notification system for user communications

## Business Model

The platform facilitates property rentals by connecting hosts who have properties to rent with guests seeking accommodation, similar to Airbnb's marketplace model.
