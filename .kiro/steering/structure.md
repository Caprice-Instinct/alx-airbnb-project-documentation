# Project Structure & Organization

## Current Repository Layout

This repository contains **design and planning documentation** for the Airbnb Clone backend project:

```
├── data-flow-diagram/     # System data flow visualizations
├── features-and-functionalities/  # Core feature specifications
├── flowcharts/           # Process flow diagrams
├── use-case-diagram/     # Actor interactions and use cases
├── user-stories/         # User requirements in story format
└── requirements.md       # Main requirements document
```

## Documentation Standards

### File Organization

- **README.md files**: Each major folder contains a README explaining its purpose and contents
- **Visual assets**: PNG diagrams accompany written documentation
- **Markdown format**: All documentation uses consistent markdown formatting

### Content Structure

- **User Stories**: Follow format "As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"
- **Features**: Organized by functional areas (User Management, Bookings, etc.)
- **Use Cases**: Grouped by actor type (Guest, Host, Admin)

## Future Code Structure Recommendations

When implementing the backend, follow these organizational patterns:

```
src/
├── controllers/     # API endpoint handlers
├── models/         # Database models and schemas
├── middleware/     # Authentication, validation, error handling
├── routes/         # API route definitions
├── services/       # Business logic layer
├── utils/          # Helper functions and utilities
└── config/         # Database and environment configuration
```

## Documentation Maintenance

- Keep diagrams synchronized with implementation changes
- Update user stories as requirements evolve
- Maintain clear separation between planning docs and implementation code
