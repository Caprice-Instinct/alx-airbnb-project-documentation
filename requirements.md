# Requirements Document - Airbnb Clone Backend

## Introduction

This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend system. The platform enables property rental marketplace functionality with three primary user roles: Guests (renters), Hosts (property owners), and Admins (platform managers). This specification covers the core backend features including User Authentication, Property Management, and Booking System.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user (guest, host, or admin), I want to securely register and authenticate with the platform, so that I can access role-specific features and maintain account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers with valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with appropriate role assignment
2. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an error message "Email already exists"
3. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token valid for 24 hours
4. WHEN a user provides invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error after maximum 3 attempts
5. IF a user exceeds 3 failed login attempts THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes
6. WHEN a valid JWT token is provided in API requests THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and grant access to authorized endpoints
7. WHEN an expired or invalid JWT token is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
8. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link valid for 1 hour
9. WHEN OAuth login is initiated THEN the system SHALL support Google and Facebook authentication providers

#### API Endpoints

**POST /api/auth/register**

- Input: `{ "email": "string", "password": "string", "firstName": "string", "lastName": "string", "role": "guest|host" }`
- Output: `{ "message": "User created successfully", "userId": "string" }`
- Validation: Email format, password minimum 8 characters with special characters

**POST /api/auth/login**

- Input: `{ "email": "string", "password": "string" }`
- Output: `{ "token": "string", "user": { "id": "string", "email": "string", "role": "string" } }`
- Performance: Response time < 200ms

**POST /api/auth/logout**

- Input: JWT token in Authorization header
- Output: `{ "message": "Logged out successfully" }`

**POST /api/auth/forgot-password**

- Input: `{ "email": "string" }`
- Output: `{ "message": "Reset link sent to email" }`

### Requirement 2: Property Management System

**User Story:** As a host, I want to create, update, and manage my property listings with detailed information and images, so that I can attract potential guests and maximize bookings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a host creates a new property listing with required fields THEN the system SHALL store the property with status "pending" for admin approval
2. WHEN a host uploads property images THEN the system SHALL accept up to 10 images in JPEG/PNG format, maximum 5MB each
3. WHEN a guest searches properties by location THEN the system SHALL return results within 50km radius sorted by relevance
4. WHEN a guest applies filters (price, amenities, capacity) THEN the system SHALL return matching properties with pagination (20 per page)
5. IF a property has no availability for requested dates THEN the system SHALL exclude it from search results
6. WHEN a host updates property availability THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in search results
7. WHEN an admin reviews a property THEN the system SHALL allow approval or rejection with feedback
8. WHEN a property is approved THEN the system SHALL change status to "active" and make it searchable

#### API Endpoints

**POST /api/properties**

- Input: `{ "title": "string", "description": "string", "location": "object", "pricePerNight": "number", "maxGuests": "number", "amenities": "array", "availability": "array" }`
- Output: `{ "propertyId": "string", "status": "pending", "message": "Property created successfully" }`
- Validation: Title max 100 chars, description max 1000 chars, price > 0

**GET /api/properties/search**

- Input: Query params `?location=string&checkIn=date&checkOut=date&guests=number&minPrice=number&maxPrice=number&amenities=array&page=number`
- Output: `{ "properties": "array", "totalCount": "number", "currentPage": "number", "totalPages": "number" }`
- Performance: Response time < 500ms, support 1000 concurrent searches

**PUT /api/properties/:id**

- Input: Property ID in URL, updated fields in body
- Output: `{ "message": "Property updated successfully" }`
- Authorization: Only property owner or admin

**DELETE /api/properties/:id**

- Input: Property ID in URL
- Output: `{ "message": "Property deleted successfully" }`
- Authorization: Only property owner or admin

### Requirement 3: Booking Management System

**User Story:** As a guest, I want to book available properties for specific dates with secure payment processing, so that I can reserve accommodation and receive booking confirmation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest selects available dates for a property THEN the system SHALL calculate total cost including taxes and fees
2. WHEN a guest initiates booking THEN the system SHALL temporarily hold the dates for 15 minutes during payment
3. WHEN payment is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL confirm the booking and send confirmation emails
4. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL release the held dates and notify the guest
5. IF booking dates conflict with existing reservations THEN the system SHALL return an error "Dates not available"
6. WHEN a booking is confirmed THEN the system SHALL update property availability and notify the host
7. WHEN a guest cancels within cancellation policy THEN the system SHALL process refund according to policy terms
8. WHEN a host cancels a confirmed booking THEN the system SHALL issue full refund and apply penalty to host
9. WHEN booking check-in date arrives THEN the system SHALL change booking status to "active"

#### API Endpoints

**POST /api/bookings**

- Input: `{ "propertyId": "string", "checkInDate": "date", "checkOutDate": "date", "guests": "number", "paymentMethodId": "string" }`
- Output: `{ "bookingId": "string", "totalAmount": "number", "status": "confirmed", "confirmationCode": "string" }`
- Validation: Check-in date >= today, check-out > check-in, guests <= property max

**GET /api/bookings/user/:userId**

- Input: User ID in URL, optional status filter
- Output: `{ "bookings": "array" }`
- Authorization: User can only view own bookings

**PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel**

- Input: Booking ID in URL, cancellation reason
- Output: `{ "message": "Booking cancelled", "refundAmount": "number", "refundStatus": "string" }`
- Business Rule: Apply cancellation policy for refund calculation

**GET /api/bookings/:id**

- Input: Booking ID in URL
- Output: `{ "booking": "object", "property": "object", "guest": "object", "host": "object" }`
- Authorization: Only booking participants (guest, host) or admin

#### Performance Criteria

- **Concurrent Bookings**: Support 500 simultaneous booking requests
- **Payment Processing**: Complete within 30 seconds
- **Database Transactions**: Ensure ACID compliance for booking operations
- **Availability Updates**: Real-time synchronization across all property searches

#### Validation Rules

**General Input Validation:**

- All email addresses must follow RFC 5322 standard
- All dates must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- All monetary values must be positive numbers with 2 decimal places
- All text inputs must be sanitized against XSS attacks

**Business Logic Validation:**

- Booking dates cannot overlap with existing confirmed bookings
- Property prices must be within reasonable range ($1 - $10,000 per night)
- User roles must be validated for each endpoint access
- File uploads must be scanned for malware

#### Security Requirements

- All API endpoints require HTTPS encryption
- JWT tokens must be signed with RS256 algorithm
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP address
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration for allowed origins only
