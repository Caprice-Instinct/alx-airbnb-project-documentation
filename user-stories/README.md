# User Stories – Airbnb Clone

This directory contains the **user stories** derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone backend project.  
User stories describe the system’s functionalities from the perspective of its users (Guests, Hosts, and Admins).  

## Purpose
The objective of this document is to translate the interactions in the use case diagram into user stories that define what users want to achieve and why. These stories serve as the foundation for guiding development and ensuring the system meets user needs.

## Content
- **user-stories.md**: A collection of user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend.  
  - Covers key actions for Guests (registration, booking, payments, reviews).  
  - Includes Host actions (managing listings and bookings).  
  - Includes Admin actions (user management, listing moderation, reporting).  

## Example User Story
> *As a guest, I want to search and filter properties so that I can find accommodation that matches my preferences.*

## How It Fits in the Project
- **Task Source**: Based on the features and use case diagram from Task 1.  
- **Usage**: Developers and stakeholders can reference these stories to understand the user needs and prioritize backend development.
